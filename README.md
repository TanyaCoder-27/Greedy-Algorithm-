# Greedy-Algorithm-

A Greedy Algorithm is a problem-solving approach that makes a sequence of choices, each of which is the best at that moment, with the hope of finding the global optimum. The algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

## Key Concepts:
Greedy Choice Property: This property states that a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by selecting the local optimal choice.

Optimal Substructure: A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the subproblems.

## Steps in a Greedy Algorithm:
Selection: Select the best option available.

Feasibility: Ensure the option is feasible (does not violate any constraints).

Incorporation: Incorporate the selected option into the solution.

Repeat: Repeat the process until a complete solution is reached.

## Examples of popular Greedy Algorithms are:
Fractional Knapsack, Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, Huffman coding and Prim's Algorithm
